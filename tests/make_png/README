INSTRUCTIONS 

NOTE: One version of FreeType is referred as "base" version and the 
      other as the "test" version.

  1. Get the two versions ready
  -------------------------------------
    Make two folders named "test" and "base" preferably in the home 
    directory.

    Next, download an older version of FreeType (For example : 2.6.5)
    ( This being the "base" version of the two)
    Go to 'include/freetype/ftoption.h' and uncomment this line 

        #define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING
  
  2. Compile the two versions 
  -------------------------------------     
   Go to the "base" version's folder and compile the library

	    ./configure
	    make 

    Repeat step 2. for the "test" version as well.

 3. Compile the code
  -------------------------------------     
    Return to this folder and make the binary

 	make tests [options]

    Set resolution in DPI by passing argument to variable DPI.
    Example: make tests DPI=100, if not specified,default is 72.

    Set the Rendering mode by passing FT_TEST_RENDER_MODE.
    <render_mode> can take values 1. MONO
    							  2. AA
    							  3. RGB
    							  4. BGR
    							  5. VRGB
    							  6. VBGR
    ( Example: make tests FT_TEST_RENDER_MODE=RGB )

 4. Run the executable
  ------------------------------------- 

	sh runme.sh <a> <font_file> <pt_size> 

    <a> is directory of the 'base' FreeType version. 
    ( The path to these should be absolute. )

	Open ./html/index.html for "list-view"
