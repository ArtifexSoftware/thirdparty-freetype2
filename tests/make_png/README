NOTE: First make freetype library (in the ../../ directory)
  make devel
  make
 
TODO:   Generate HTML page for detailed comparison

/*******************************************************************/

To generate sprite sheets in the /images folder and to generate the
"index.html" (List-View) of the glyphs.

By clicking on the Headers of the respective columns,they can be
arranged (in increasing/decreasing order) based on
->  Glyph-Index
->  Name
->  Difference Metric (right now it is the number of pixels that are
    different between the base and the test glyph)

It displays the whole sprite sheet right now (will be used later)
Hashes will be diplayed (To be implemented)

First compile and install two versions of the FreeType libray 
in different folders (with SUBPIXEL_RENDERING enabled in ftoption.h)


1)  make sprite
    (set resoluton in DPI by passing argument
    example: make DPI=100, if not specified,default is 72)

2)  Usage ./sprite <a> <b> <font_file> <pt_size> <render_mode>

    (<a> is the libfreetype.so from the base vesion )
    (<b> is the libfreetype.so from the test vesion )

    The path to the "shared library" in usage should be absolute.

    Sprite Sheets will be saved as sprite_$(glyph_index).png

    Render modes similar to generating PNG(s).

NOTE: If the dimensions of the two glyphs to be compared are
different, comparison is done after aligning the glyphs.
This alignment will effect the 'Difference Metric' based on the 
number of rows/columns added.
