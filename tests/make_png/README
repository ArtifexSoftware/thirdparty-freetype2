INSTRUCTIONS 

NOTE: One version of FreeType is referred as "base" version and the 
      other as the "test" version.

  1. Get the two versions ready
  -------------------------------------
    Make two folders named "test" and "base" preferably in the home 
    directory.

    Next, download an older version of FreeType (For example : 2.6.5)
    ( This being the "test" version of the two)
    Go to 'include/freetype/ftoption.h' and uncomment this line 

        #define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING
  
  2. Install the two versions 
  -------------------------------------     
   Go to the "test" version's folder and change the default 
   installation directory to the "test" folder created.

	./configure --prefix=<path>

    Compile and install the library

	make 
 	make install

    Repeat step 2. for the "base" version as well.

 3. Compile the code
  -------------------------------------     
    Return to this folder and make the binary

 	make

    (set resolution in DPI by passing argument
    example: make DPI=100, if not specified,default is 72)

 3. Run the executable
  ------------------------------------- 

	./sprite <a> <b> <font_file> <pt_size> <render_mode>

    <a> is the libfreetype.so from the base vesion. 
    <b> is the libfreetype.so from the test vesion.

    ( <a> and <b> are in <base/test version's installation folder>/lib/ )
    ( The path to these should be absolute. )
